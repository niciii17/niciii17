# 👋 Hi, I'm Nicola Eschbach

I'm a passionate software engineer and outdoor enthusiast based in Switzerland 🇨🇭.

By day, I build web applications — crafting clean, scalable code and pixel-perfect interfaces.  
By weekend (or whenever the wind is right), you'll find me high in the mountains — hiking, flying, and capturing breathtaking moments from the sky.
